# hello-world

Hello!

I am an astronomy graduate student writing code mainly for my research, but also just for fun!
I really like Python, but would like to learn R, Java, Ruby, C/C++/C#, and more.

I will be posting some of my projects here to advertise my work and hopefully become a better programmer.
